        ## Description
        
        Use Python? Want to geocode something? Looking for directions?
        Maybe matrices of directions? This library brings the Google Maps Platform Web
        Services to your Python application.
        
        The Python Client for Google Maps Services is a Python Client library for the following Google Maps
        APIs:
        
         - Directions API
         - Distance Matrix API
         - Elevation API
         - Geocoding API
         - Geolocation API
         - Time Zone API
         - Roads API
         - Places API
         - Maps Static API
         - Address Validation API
        
        Keep in mind that the same [terms and conditions](https://developers.google.com/maps/terms) apply
        to usage of the APIs when they're accessed through this library.
        
        ## Support
        
        This library is community supported. We're comfortable enough with the stability and features of
        the library that we want you to build real production applications on it. We will try to support,
        through Stack Overflow, the public and protected surface of the library and maintain backwards
        compatibility in the future; however, while the library is in version 0.x, we reserve the right
        to make backwards-incompatible changes. If we do remove some functionality (typically because
        better functionality exists or if the feature proved infeasible), our intention is to deprecate
        and give developers a year to update their code.
        
        If you find a bug, or have a feature suggestion, please log an issue. If you'd like to
        contribute, please read contribute.
        
        ## Requirements
        
         - Python 3.5 or later.
         - A Google Maps API key.
        
        ## API Keys
        
        Each Google Maps Web Service request requires an API key or client ID. API keys
        are generated in the 'Credentials' page of the 'APIs & Services' tab of [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
        
        For even more information on getting started with Google Maps Platform and generating/restricting an API key, see [Get Started with Google Maps Platform](https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started) in our docs.
        
        **Important:** This key should be kept secret on your server.
        
        ## Installation
        
            $ pip install -U googlemaps
        
        Note that you will need requests 2.4.0 or higher if you want to specify connect/read timeouts.
        
        ## Usage
        
        This example uses the Geocoding API and the Directions API with an API key:
        
        ```python
        import googlemaps
        from datetime import datetime
        
        gmaps = googlemaps.Client(key='Add Your Key here')
        
        # Geocoding an address
        geocode_result = gmaps.geocode('1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA')
        
        # Look up an address with reverse geocoding
        reverse_geocode_result = gmaps.reverse_geocode((40.714224, -73.961452))
        
        # Request directions via public transit
        now = datetime.now()
        directions_result = gmaps.directions("Sydney Town Hall",
                                             "Parramatta, NSW",
                                             mode="transit",
                                             departure_time=now)
        
        # Validate an address with address validation
        addressvalidation_result =  gmaps.addressvalidation(['1600 Amphitheatre Pk'], 
                                                            regionCode='US',
                                                            locality='Mountain View', 
                                                            enableUspsCass=True)
        ```
        
        For more usage examples, check out [the tests](https://github.com/googlemaps/google-maps-services-python/tree/master/tests).
        
        ## Features
        
        ### Retry on Failure
        
        Automatically retry when intermittent failures occur. That is, when any of the retriable 5xx errors
        are returned from the API.
        
        
        ## Building the Project
        
        
            # Installing nox
